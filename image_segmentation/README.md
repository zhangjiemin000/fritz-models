# Fritz Image Segmentation
A library for training mobile-friendly semantic segmentation models.

Semantic segmentation models take an image as input and output a class prediction for each pixel, effectively masking objects.

You can add image segmentation to your app for free at [www.fritz.ai](https://www.fritz.ai/features/image-segmentation.html?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=fritz-models&utm_content=image-segmentation). Ready-to-use image segmentation APIs are available for three scenes: `people`, `outdoors`, `living rooms`.

If you'd like to train a custom image segmentation model, you can follow the instructions below. Pre-packaged, easy to use notebooks are available via our [Premium plan](https://www.fritz.ai/pricing/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=fritz-models&utm_content=image-segmentation). For more information, contact us at [help@fritz.ai](mailto:help@fritz.ai).

## Installation

From this directory, run:

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`
```

## Download Data
The model is trained on the [ADE20K dataset](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/) provided by MIT. You can download and prepare this data for training using this [handy script](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/deeplab/datasets/download_and_convert_ade20k.sh) provided in the `TensorFlow/models/research/deeplab` repo on GitHub.

The dataset contains >20,000 images and corresponding segmentation masks. Masks asign one of 150 categories to each individual pixel of the image. A list of object classes is included in this repo: [objectInfo150.txt]()

## Create TFRecord Dataset

Training requires data be read from TFRecords so we'll need to convert the images before we can use them. It's also recommended you train choose less than 20 image labels to train on as performance degrades after this point. The full 150 class labels is too much. A whitelist of class labels can be passed via the command line in a pipe separated string. Note that class labels much match those in the `objectInfo150.txt` exactly. Examples of valid whitelists are:

```
"person|wall|floor, flooring"
"chair|wall|coffee table, cocktail table|ceiling|floor, flooring|bed|lamp|sofa, couch, lounge|windowpane, window|pillow"
```

You can also set the `whitelist-threshold` argument to specify the fraction of whitelisted labels that must appear in an image for it to be used in training. For example, if 10 labels are whitelisted and the threashold is set to 0.6, at least 6 of the 10 whitelisted labels must appear in the image for it to be included.

Let's create a training data set for images with objects you might find in a living room or bedroom.

```
export LABEL_SET=living_room
mkdir data/${LABEL_SET}
python create_tfrecord_dataset.py \
    -i data/ADEChallengeData2016/images/training/ \
    -a data/ADEChallengeData2016/annotations/training/ \
    -o data/${LABEL_SET}/${LABEL_SET}_data.tfrecord \
    -l data/objectInfo150.txt \
    -w "chair|wall|coffee table, cocktail table|ceiling|floor, flooring|bed|lamp|sofa, couch, lounge|windowpane, window|pillow" \
    -t 0.6
```

This script also automatically outputs a new set of labels and indices in a file named `labels.txt` found in the same directory as the `.tfrecord` output.

## Training
The model can be trained using the `train.py` script.

Before you start, make sure the `image_segmentation` model is on your $PYTHONPATH. From the `fritz-models/image_segmentation` directory.

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`
```

### Train Locally
Train the model for 10 steps by running:

```
export LABEL_SET=living_room
python image_segmentation/train.py \
    -d data/${LABEL_SET}/${LABEL_SET}_data.tfrecord \
    -l data/${LABEL_SET}/labels.txt \
    -n 10 \
    -s 768 \
    -a 0.25 \
    -o data/${LABEL_SET}/${LABEL_SET}_icnet_768x768_025.h5 \
    --model-name ${LABEL_SET}
```

By default, a model weights checkpoint is saved every epoch. Note that only weights are saved, not the full model. This is to make it easier to build models for training vs inference.

### Training on Google Cloud ML
Zip up all of the local files to send up to Google Cloud.

```
# from fritz-models/image_segmentation/
python setup.py sdist
```
Run the training job.

```
export LABEL_SET=living_room
export YOUR_GCS_BUCKET=<YOUR_BUCKET_HERE>
gcloud ml-engine jobs submit training `whoami`_image_segmentation_`date +%s` \
    --runtime-version 1.9 \
    --job-dir=gs://${YOUR_GCS_BUCKET} \
    --packages dist/image_segmentation-1.0.tar.gz \
    --module-name image_segmentation.train \
    --region us-east1 \
    --scale-tier basic_gpu \
    -- \
    -d gs://${YOUR_GCS_BUCKET}/data/${LABEL_SET}/${LABEL_SET}_data.tfrecord \
    -l gs://${YOUR_GCS_BUCKET}/data/${LABEL_SET}/labels.txt \
    -o ${LABEL_SET}_768x768_025.h5 \
    --image-size 768 \
    --alpha 0.25 \
    --num-steps 5000 \
    --batch-size 24 \
    --model-name ${LABEL_SET} \
    --gcs-bucket gs://${YOUR_GCS_BUCKET}/train
```

## Converting to Core ML
The resulting Keras model can be converted using the script provided. It uses the standard `coremltools` package, but removes the additional model output nodes used for training.

```
python convert_to_coreml.py --alpha 0.25 ${LABEL_SET}_768x768_025.h5 ${LABEL_SET}_768x768_025.mlmodel
```

Once you've got your Core ML model, you can use [Fritz](https://fritz.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=fritz-models&utm_content=image-segmentation) to integrate, deploy, and manage it in your app. For more tutorials on mobile machine learning, check out [Heartbeat](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=fritz-models&utm_content=image-segmentation).

## Benchmarks
On a Google Cloud Compute GPU instance with a single K80, a single epoch containing roughly 1600 768x768 images takes 20 minutes. Average cross-categorical accuracy reached >80% after 12 hours. An additional 3 hours of training with a learning rate of 0.00001 increased accuracy to ~87%. Inferences with a 768x768 model can be made at 8-9fps on an iPhone X.
